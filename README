CrmEmail
========

This is an IMAP email plugin for Fat Free CRM (FFC). Inbound and out  bound email processing seem to work. I will continue testing. 

It uses the concept of drop box for integrating email with FFC. While sending email to a contact, the user will bcc to the dropbox address. The user will forward any  email received from contacts to the dropbox  address. 


Setup
=======
- Install this gem for scheduling
  gem install rufus-scheduler
  
- Create settings.yml from the sample settings.yml.sample in the config dir and edit according to your needs
  :mode - Set to prod
  :server - imap server URL
  :port - imap port number
  :ssl - Set to true or false
  :user - Imap login ID
  :password  - imap login password
  :folder  - Folder to be accessed. Typically it's inbox
  :move_folder  - Folder where email should be moved after processing. if you want email to be deleted after processing do not provide any folder name
  :schedule - Schedule for running background email task. For example '2h' for running every 2 hours or '0 22 * * 1-5' for every day of the week at 10 PM
  :create_contact - if set to true contact will be created if the contact lookup based on email fails for inbound and out bound emails
  :admin_port - Ignore this
  
- Run this rake task to load the settings data for this plugin 
  rake crm_email:settings:load
  
- To update settings data any time, edit settings.yml and run the following rake task
  rake crm_email:settings:reload
  
- Run the the generator from fat_free_crm project root as follows. This will create the db migration file for this plugin in the FFC db/migrate directory
  ruby script/generate crm_email
 
- Create crm_email related db schema by running
  rake db:migrate

Usage
=====
- For outbound email, when sending email to your contact from your email client bcc to the dropbox address
- For inbound email from your contact, forward received email to the dropbox address
